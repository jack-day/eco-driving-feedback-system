# Simulated GPS Data
# ----------------------------------
# Time intervals are used as keys
# - Time intervals are the seconds since the script started running
# - These are used to switch test coordinates after a specified time
# - The coordinates returned to the application are interpolated if the current
#   time is in-between time intervals.
# - In this example, we have the time intervals 0, 2, 3, 18, 19 and 40
# - Time intervals loop infinitely, meaning after 40 seconds, the program begins
#   to use the coordinates from 0 seconds again
